HI! Welcome to my digital home on the internet

I am currently in my final year at PES University, Bangalore. This is my place to talk about my ideas, experiences, books and shower thoughts. Feel free to navigate around using tags if that's any easier :)

The project I am currently working on is my Capstone project, Forensic Analysis for a compromised distributed environment.
Would love to ideate? You can always reach out to me on any of my mentioned socials, though mail is preferred.

Have a nice morning/evening â˜•
