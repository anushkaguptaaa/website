HI! Welcome to my digital home on the internet

- I am currently in my final year at PES University, Bangalore.
- Interning at [Schneider](https://www.se.com/ww/en/)!
- Finished my Capstone project on Distributed Systems and Computer Networks!
- Absolutely love talking about stocks, productivity, books, camera, vlogging and personal finance
- I love working out (though I am struggling to keep up with working out 5-6 times a week. Its really hard when you have just begun corporate ;-; )
- Currently reading [No Rules Rules](https://amzn.eu/d/9gjNreZ) by Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer
- An article I found interesting: [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

This is my place to talk about my ideas, experiences, books and shower thoughts. Feel free to navigate around using tags if that's any easier :) Would love to ideate? You can always reach out to me on any of my mentioned socials, though mail is preferred.

Have a nice morning/evening â˜•
