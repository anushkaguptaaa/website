It’s internals day today, and if you come from the same university as I do, it is every alternate week. I still don’t get the point of 5 internal exams in one semester. The sleep deprived and tired me chose to go in an auto rickshaw because I don’t want sleep deprivation to be the reason for any road accidents. Scrambling through my class notes and last minute scribbles, I am hyper focused on retaining as much information as I can and no bumpy road can get in between my minor success. But I’m only human.

Just like any other whale, I too will come up to the surface of a sea of information to breathe.

To take a break.

Only to see something from the dark side of life.

It’s pivot. Someone’s ending. Death.

What I saw in that brief second, was a man in a glass coffin.

The word ‘Ambulance’ was written on the top right hand corner. It took me a minute but I came back to my senses, brushed it off and went on with my day. Consoled myself that it is also a part of life.

What I really want to tell you about is, what I saw when I was coming back home.

That same place had flowers. A basket-full of flowers.

On the side of the road, in the middle, everywhere.

A trail of flowers.

It made me realize that we all want to do this.

Leave behind a trail of flowers on the road of life.

Some would be long, some short.

We might be a delta on the road of life, or maybe not.

It then boils down to on whose road we leave the longest trail.

A trail of flowers after the glass coffin is gone.
