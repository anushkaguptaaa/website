I often find a good linkstash attached to a dev folk's website. I must say they end up being classic finds which completely nerd snipe me.

You can check out my curated list of cool link in this [Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/anushkagupta/1f56ef2f7d254df7ba23617437b86474?v=8feb5bc23b2b40e596c00e0aae5ed1fd).
All thanks to my tendencies to document things and [Notion Web Clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper), the luxury of being able to search on the basis of tags is possible xD
