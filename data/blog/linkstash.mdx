I often find a good linkstash attached to a dev folk's website. I must say they end up being classic finds which completely nerd snipe me.

You might even find a link to my notion pages just because of the sheer amount of enjoyment I get from curating one. Plus the added benefit to search on the basis of what you are in the mood for. This luxury is really unparalleled xD

For now, here's a short trailer.
