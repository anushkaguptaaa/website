During my high school years, I was particularly fascinated by Physics and all the math that was related to defining what this universe is. A good starting point came from learning about [Special Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) described by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in 1905.
It neatly defines the relationship between space and time.
