During my high school years, I was particularly fascinated by Physics and all the math that was related to defining what this universe is. A good starting point came from learning about [Special Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) described by [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) in 1905.
It neatly defines the relationship between space and time.

With every Physics problem comes the math. Surely not every math concept fascinates me but this partculary one did: [Ramanujan Summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_summation)

This one is so so neat! Just look at how you'd not want to believe in it until you see the working. The sum of the natural numbers is actually a negative fraction.

I loved this math so much that I ended up gifting it to my friend in the form of a letter in a pretty handwriting. So if the person is reading this blogpost, you know it's you.

Strangely when I went back to search about read this, I found alternate workings to the value of the summation. I'll and update this when I get the intent to finish it.
