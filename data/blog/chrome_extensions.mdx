This article initially had a very long passage trying to convince the reader to first, use chrome; and second, read the whole article xD None of that you'd see now! Your time is precious. So just skim and see if there's something you found interesting and more importantly, new.

1. [AdBlock](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-block-ads-acros/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) - Surprisingly smooth
2. [Avira Password Manager](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/avira-password-manager/caljgklbbfbcjjanaijlacgncafpegll) - This _never_ disappointed me!

3. [Notion Web Clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper) - Cool for curating your [linkstash](https://www.anushkagupta.in/blog/linkstash) on Notion

4. [Dark Reader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh) - Dark Mode for chrome

5. [Hoppscotch Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hoppscotch-browser-extens/amknoiejhlmhancpahfcfcfhllgkpbld)

6. [Forest](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/forest-stay-focused-be-pr/kjacjjdnoddnpbbcjilcajfhhbdhkpgk) - It's free on chrome

7. [Instapaper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/instapaper/ldjkgaaoikpmhmkelcgkgacicjfbofhh) - The way it integrates with the mobile app, NEAT!

8. [Minimal Theme for Twitter (now X)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp) - Have this one, makes the experience so much better. I don't care too much for the popular hastags.

9. [Save to Pocket](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj)

10. [JSON Formatter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa) - This makes me not squint my eyes at the screen xD

11. [TickTick](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ticktick-todo-task-list/diankknpkndanachmlckaikddgcehkod) - Only if you are using the app on your phone. The widget for habit tracking on phone is too good!

12. [Minimal YouTube Theme](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/minimal-youtube-theme/ccplmbjcmgejfkggenhjagijijklnacm) - By far the best one, even enabling grayscale

13. [Minimal YouTube Homepage](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/minimal-youtube-homepage/jkjgfpleclhnfnlnbhhodecfcpfdiblc) - Only makes the homepage minimal incase, rest everything remains the same.
