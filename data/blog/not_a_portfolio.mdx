## Working

- I don’t want my website to be only resumé related
- this is my small home in this large world
- My small host in the network of computers
- Who inspired me? Ankur Warikoo :)
- why? Because his newsletters have always been an absolute delight to read
  - Talking about imperfections, worldly observations
  - Funny incidents
  - his failures, his issues about him related to literally anything
- Sure, talking about myself and all the thoughts I’ve had isn’t very cool when all my collegemates make a website only showcasing my projects
- But who cares, I not here to follow conventions, here to make things conventional.
  - Sure my decision of not keeping my website limit to CS is not path-breaking
  - trust me, it’s my way of feeling good about not being a carbon copy of the stereotype xD
- Sometimes my reading can be lengthy, and sometimes very short with grammatical errors
- But I’m willing to take the risk to look like a fool, because there are bigger things to look at than to worry about shuffling the tense in the same sentence (hehe)
- This website will show both sides of me, the very formal professional side, and the more imperfect annoyed upset side too.
  - why? Because I not only choose to, but also want you to see

### Things about me

- I am not a complete extrovert, I sometimes get overwhelmed with too many conversations in a day
- When I’m around people I really care for, I cry and crib like a three-year old
- I fail soo many times
- I doubt, judge, over-criticize and point fingers at myself, _very_ regularly
- I wrote this even before having a website in the first place.
  - Because I knew I will make one someday
  - Because I wanted one soo badly
  - Because I knew I will put this in my blog unapologetically with minimal editing
- I compare myself way too much (safe to call me Virus from 3 Idiots, no joke!
