Today I’ve waited the whole day for one episode. One last episode of Young Sheldon. Unless Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady decide to start a new show in the Big Bang Universe (Get it?)

It started long back when I was in High School that I got introduced to Young Sheldon for the first time. I didn’t know about, which would end up being called my favourite show, The Big Bang Theory.

Heck I might even call this my home. My comfort zone, where I get a 20 minute break (sometimes it’s an hour) from my actual life. An escape from the gigantically intertwined known-unknown variables in this world where, whether I like it or not, I don’t have too much control.

I moved from high school to college to my first corporate firm and I have continued to wait for Young Sheldon episodes. Week after week, for years and phases of my own life dealing with all my ups and lows. Sometimes I’d even catch myself not dealing with adversity and would feel super grateful to be watching it when I was happy. Sheldon, both the younger and older, always gave me comfort. Not only because I resonated with him but also because of where his interests lied in.

Physics. I fell in love with Physics and Astronomy at a very young age and with the calculations of Physics in 9th grade a bit too hard. I fell in head over heels in love with it. I couldn’t stop thinking equations looking at car moving around. Even those annoying ones that would consistently honk as they passed by, and a frequency time graph would just show up in the air for me.

I'm not too sure if I am ready to even watch the last episode. Because I would genuinely miss it and the ritual of waiting is going to cease. I hope I find the comfort and excitement while rewatching the show.

Live Long and Prosper.
