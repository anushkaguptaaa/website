I’ve teared up an embarrassing number of times, I’ve been hurting thinking about his preparation for his family post departure

- I’ve paid attention to a lot of things in the book
- I highlighted so much
- He got me mildly interested in Human computer Interaction
- If I were to teach someday, I want to teach like he teaches
- If I were to ever die due to terminal cancer, I want live life like him
- I’m a little less scared about death now
