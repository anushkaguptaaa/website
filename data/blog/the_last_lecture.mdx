I am writing this blog in the middle of the night probably because I'm in a mood. I can't pinpoint to what exactly is causing this but surely I'm in the mood to finally write this down.

Here, I can pinpoint what stopped me from completely writing this one. It is the fact that I have to fully come in terms with the fact that [Randy Pausch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Pausch) is no more. Its going to be 16 years now. (25 July 2008)

I am blasting his [last lecture](https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo?si=pZ9cwbAEryciJihY) on full volume as I write. He just demostrated his push-ups and I'm giggling at his jokes. The draft that I had wrote for this article is so powerful that it did take me 2 years back. I remember how reading his [book](https://amzn.in/d/0i2Vxn3V) made me feel. Writing the summary down with blurry eyes and crying myself to sleep as if I'd lost a family member and how I ruminated on how his family dealt with this. The book didn't feel enough, I had to watch the lecture.

Side Note: Man! He is funny. <br/>
He's shitting on Macintosh and calling it a near-death experience xD

The way he explained the things he dared to dream and dared more to make it happen by making paths from himself is fascinating. Calling his the local journalist just to get into the Vomit Comet. I honestly got so inspired from him that I _have_ blatantly copied his dreams. Call it 'happy coincidence' or whatever, as these are things that I had dreamed off. Although, from a broader spectrum. I want to be in Vomit Comet too and I too want to work at Disneyland for a day!

Watching his other lectures gave me so much direction, I'm just so glad that CMU uploaded it. I even got interested in Human Computer Interaction just because he taught it. How can someone like him be so full of life at their terminal stages? Regardless of the preparation that took to give this lecture, how did he not end up breaking down in front of an audience?

I really want to live life the way he did. <br/>
I want to teach the way he did. <br/>
I want to crack jokes like he did. <br/>
I want face death like he did.

Thank you, Randy. <br/>
For leaving behind a legacy that still teaches.
